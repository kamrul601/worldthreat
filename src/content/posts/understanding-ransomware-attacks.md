Ransomware attacks have exploded in recent years, costing organizations billions of dollars and causing significant disruption to critical infrastructure. Understanding how these attacks work is the first step in protecting yourself.

## What is Ransomware?

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts your files or locks you out of your systems, demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency) to restore access. Modern ransomware has evolved beyond simple encryption to include data theft and public exposure threats.

## Common Attack Vectors

Ransomware typically enters systems through:

- **Phishing emails** with malicious attachments or links
- **Compromised websites** that deliver drive-by downloads
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** vulnerabilities
- **Software vulnerabilities** in outdated systems
- **Supply chain attacks** through trusted software updates

## Protection Strategies

To protect against ransomware:

1. **Maintain regular backups** stored offline or in immutable cloud storage
2. **Keep all software updated** with the latest security patches
3. **Implement email filtering** to block malicious attachments
4. **Use multi-factor authentication** on all accounts
5. **Train employees** to recognize phishing attempts
6. **Segment your network** to limit lateral movement

## If You're Attacked

If you fall victim to ransomware:

- Disconnect affected systems from the network immediately
- Do not pay the ransom without consulting experts
- Report the incident to law enforcement
- Engage incident response professionals
- Restore from clean backups after the threat is eliminated

The ransomware threat will continue to evolve. Staying informed and prepared is your best defense.
